This is an attempt to create a chatbot. Have made use of Slack's api to host the bot.

Currently, the bot can provide weather and time information for Singapore. It can also provide responses for certain pre defined questions. These are indicated in the pattern_response json document.

Converts the input string into 1's and 0's based on the already stemmed words of all the input patterns.
